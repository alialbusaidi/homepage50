HTML Tags:
1. <body> - it's like the main part of the website
2. <header> - I used this for the top banner thingy
3. <h1> - main heading inside the header
4. <nav> - this is where the menu goes
5. <ul> - for making a list in the menu
6. <li> - each item in the list
7. <a> - links for navigation
8. <main> - central area of the site content
9. <section> - I used this to group the content in the main area
10. <footer> - bottom part of the page

CSS Properties:
1. font-family - used this to make all the text look the same
2. background-color - sets background colors, like for the header and footer
3. padding - adds space inside boxes to not squash stuff together
4. margin - adds space outside boxes for better spacing
5. box-shadow - gives a shadow effect to sections, makes it look cool

JavaScript:
Added some simple code to toggle the nav menu on mobile. Makes the menu show up when you click a button.

Bootstrap:
Used bootstrap to help with the responsive layout. Just added a link to it in the head and used the container class for the main area.
